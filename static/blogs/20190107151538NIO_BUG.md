## NIO BUG

During the test of my server, I find my application works well in windows but it fails in Ubuntu. I find in the request of a image, the original size is 196KB, but I only got 138KB or 140KB. 
The original send code is as follow
```java
ByteBuffer block = ByteBuffer.wrap(msg);
response.write(block);
```

After a few debug progress. I find the correct code is
```java
ByteBuffer block = ByteBuffer.wrap(msg);
int len = msg.length;
int sendLen = 0;
//send byte
while(sendLen < len) {
    sendLen += response.write(block);
}
```
Actually, the max write size in my linux server is 144540. which is less than the size of my image. So we need to write many times to ensure no loss bytes.
