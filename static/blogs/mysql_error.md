# Mysql Fail Recorder

Recently, I always get up and find my website's tool, rate tool, is down. I can get JSON object but only get 0 value.
After log in to my server, I find my Mysql server is down. it shows 
```bash
root@HTTP_Server:~# mysql
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
```

It looks like I can not connect to my server.

Using follow command it says
```bash
root@HTTP_Server:~# /etc/init.d/mysql status
● mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sat 2018-12-29 15:44:56 UTC; 2h 31min ago

```
So, I looking for the mysql error log and find the problem.

```
So it looks like I do not have much ram for my innodb buffer pool. Using top I find
```text
top - 19:08:57 up 59 days, 27 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
Tasks:  85 total,   2 running,  82 sleeping,   1 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  0.3 us,  0.7 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
MiB Mem :    481.2 total,     12.1 free,    384.2 used,     85.0 buff/cache
MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.     84.6 avail Mem
```

So I looking for ```vi /etc/init.d/mysql``` and find the configuration file is at ```/etc/mysql/my.cnf```, change it to 
```
[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 16M
```
then start mysql server, every thing is fine now.
```

```

But there is still a question: I start my mysql server yesterday successful, why it do not report this error that time?
